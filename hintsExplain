How I solved the problem. Some explains:

setMineFiled don't need many explain. I divide parts between new line and check how many signs have.
If numbers in each part is the same and value is correcly. Mine filed is setted.


getHintField

    // We have 9 currently possible position in our game
		// 4 corners when we have 3 adjacent fields
		// 4 sides when we have 5 adjacent fields
		// 1 center when must check all around fields
		//
		//                                 _
		//  x=0 |_|                 x max | |
		//
		//       _					       _
		//  y=0  _|                 y max |_
		//
		//											_
		// x=0 & y=0  _|            x=max & y=max  |
		//
		//									     _
		// x=0 & y=max |_           x=max & y=0   |
		//
		//   	    _
		//   else  |_|
		//

We check the field after the field and on finished we return value.

After I finished this exercise, I realized maybe better will be with Stream but no.
And this is why I have 2 solutions. Maybe with longer value.
